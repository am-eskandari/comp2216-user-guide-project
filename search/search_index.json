Column A vertical series of cells in a spreadsheet; identified by letters (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). Formula An expression in Excel that performs calculations using cell references, values, and functions to return a specific result. Function A predefined formula in Excel that performs specific calculations or actions using the specified arguments. Pivot Table A powerful data summarization and analysis tool in Excel that allows users to easily arrange, filter, and summarize large datasets. Row A horizontal series of cells in a spreadsheet; identified by numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). Spreadsheet A digital document consisting of rows and columns used for organizing, analyzing, and storing data. Workbook An Excel file that contains one or more spreadsheets, also known as worksheets. Worksheet An individual spreadsheet within a workbook, containing rows, columns, and cells to store and manipulate data. Data Range A group of contiguous cells in a worksheet, used as a source of data for Pivot Tables, charts, or other Excel features. Absolute Reference A cell reference in a formula that remains fixed when the formula is copied or filled into other cells. An absolute reference uses a dollar sign ($) before the column and row (e.g., \\(A\\)1). Relative Reference A cell reference in a formula that adjusts automatically when the formula is copied or filled into other cells. Relative references do not use dollar signs (e.g., A1). Named Range A descriptive name assigned to a specific cell or range of cells in a worksheet, making it easier to reference in formulas or navigation. Data Validation A feature in Excel that allows users to control the type of data or values that can be entered into a cell or range of cells. Conditional Formatting A feature in Excel that allows users to apply specific formatting to cells based on the values or conditions they meet, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, or outliers in the data. Chart A visual representation of data in a worksheet, created to help users better understand and interpret the information. Charts can be in the form of bar, column, line, pie, and many other formats. Data Series A group of related data points plotted in a chart. Each data series has a unique color or pattern and is represented by a legend to differentiate it from other data series. Axis The horizontal (X-axis) or vertical (Y-axis) lines in a chart that display the numerical scale for the data being plotted. Data Label A label or annotation that displays the value or name of a data point in a chart. Legend A key that identifies the data series or categories in a chart, usually displayed as a box with a color or pattern corresponding to each data series, along with a label to describe it. <p>This glossary provides definitions for terms relevant to the guide on creating tables, formatting formulas, and creating charts in Excel.

Formula returns incorrect or unexpected results Incorrect formula syntax or reference Double-check the formula syntax, cell references, and ensure that the correct function is being used. Use Excel's built-in Formula Auditing tools (Formulas &gt; Formula Auditing) to trace errors. Chart is not displaying the correct data Incorrect data range or chart type Verify the data range selected for the chart by right-clicking the chart and choosing 'Select Data', and ensure that the appropriate chart type is being used for your data. Formatting is inconsistent or not applied correctly Conflicting formats or styles Clear all formatting from the cells (Home &gt; Editing &gt; Clear &gt; Clear Formats), and reapply the desired format or style, ensuring that there are no conflicts. Use the Format Painter tool (Home &gt; Clipboard &gt; Format Painter) to copy desired formatting from one cell to another. Unable to apply a specific function or feature Incompatible Excel version or missing add-in Ensure that your Excel version supports the desired function or feature by checking the Microsoft Excel Help Center or the function's documentation, and check if any required add-ins are installed and enabled (File &gt; Options &gt; Add-Ins). If an add-in is missing, download and install it following the add-in's instructions. Error: Circular Reference detected A formula refers to its own cell or to a chain of cells that depend on the initial cell Identify the circular reference (Formulas &gt; Error Checking &gt; Circular References), and modify the formula to remove the circular reference.
