## Task 2: Using a Formula

### Overview

In this task, we will use formulas to perform calculations on data in Excel.

### Steps

1. Open the workbook you created in Task 1 (if it isn't already open).
<br>a. Click on the Open tab.
<br>b. Click on Recent; your workbook should be here.

2. In cell B7, replace the current formula by entering the formula "=SUM(B2:B6)" to calculate the total quantity.
3. In cell C7, replace the current formula by entering the formula "=SUM(C2:C6)" to calculate the total price.
4. In cell B8, enter the formula "=AVERAGE(B2:B6)" to calculate the average quantity.
5. In cell C8, enter the formula "=AVERAGE(C2:C6)" to calculate the average price.
6. In cell B9, enter the formula "=MAX(B2:B6)" to find the highest quantity.
7. In cell C9, enter the formula "=MAX(C2:C6)" to find the highest price.
8. In cell B10, enter the formula "=MIN(B2:B6)" to find the lowest quantity.
9. In cell C10, enter the formula "=MIN(C2:C6)" to find the lowest price.
10. Click on the File tab and then click Save.
