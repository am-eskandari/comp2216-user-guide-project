|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Excel is not responding or crashing                     | Too many calculations or large dataset                 | Break your dataset into smaller segments, use manual calculation mode (File > Options > Formulas > Workbook Calculation), or upgrade your system resources.                                   |
| Formula returns incorrect or unexpected results         | Incorrect formula syntax or reference                  | Double-check the formula syntax, cell references, and ensure that the correct function is being used. Use Excel's built-in Formula Auditing tools (Formulas > Formula Auditing) to trace errors. |
| Chart is not displaying the correct data                | Incorrect data range or chart type                     | Verify the data range selected for the chart by right-clicking the chart and choosing 'Select Data', and ensure that the appropriate chart type is being used for your data.                    |
| Pivot Table is not updating or showing incorrect values | Data source has changed or data is not properly refreshed | Check the data source for the Pivot Table by right-clicking the Pivot Table and selecting 'Change Data Source', update it if necessary, and refresh the Pivot Table by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Refresh'. |
| Formatting is inconsistent or not applied correctly     | Conflicting formats or styles                          | Clear all formatting from the cells (Home > Editing > Clear > Clear Formats), and reapply the desired format or style, ensuring that there are no conflicts. Use the Format Painter tool (Home > Clipboard > Format Painter) to copy desired formatting from one cell to another. |
| Unable to apply a specific function or feature          | Incompatible Excel version or missing add-in           | Ensure that your Excel version supports the desired function or feature by checking the Microsoft Excel Help Center or the function's documentation, and check if any required add-ins are installed and enabled (File > Options > Add-Ins). If an add-in is missing, download and install it following the add-in's instructions. |
| Error: Circular Reference detected                      | A formula refers to its own cell or to a chain of cells that depend on the initial cell | Identify the circular reference (Formulas > Error Checking > Circular References), and modify the formula to remove the circular reference. Use helper cells or alternative formulas to achieve the desired result without circular references. |
