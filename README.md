# Overview of Excel User Documentation
This documentation will guide you through effectively using Microsoft Excel for various data-related tasks, and teaches you how to create and format tables, write and use formulas, and generate charts.

Topics of this document includes:

Working with spreadsheets
Creating and formatting tables
Writing and using formulas
Generating charts
Troubleshooting common issues
How We Collaborated Together

Our primary form of communication was through Discord instant messaging after brainstorming our guide idea and instruction outline over Zoom. We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation.

How We Created Our Guide
Our guide was created using our knowledge and experience working with Microsoft Excel. We referenced official Microsoft documentation and various online resources to supplement our experiential knowledge. We aimed to address the difficulties we had encountered while working with Excel and ensured our instructions were clear, complete, and concise.

Using MkDocs
We chose to use MkDocs as our static site generator because we liked the appearance of the Material for MkDocs theme and the components provided by MkDocs. One of our team members had access to additional plugins, which gave us the flexibility to customize the appearance of our documentation further.

Using Markdown
This was the first time writing extensively in markdown for two of our three group members. We learned how to style text using markdown from our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 and developed our skills over the course of writing this documentation.

Using VS Code
All three members of the group used VS Code to write our markdown files. We previewed the markdown using VS Code's built-in markdown preview, but we had to serve our guide with MkDocs to see the accurate rendering of our styles.

Using a Style Guide
We loosely used the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide to give our writing uniformity. We had previously used this style guide, and its clear documentation made it an attractive style guide to reference.

We used codeblocks to represent code. MkDocs allowed us to make annotations inside the code block that show additional information when clicked. This allowed us to explain specific lines of code without disrupting the visual flow. MkDocs also had the feature to highlight lines of code. We used this feature to highlight new additions or changes to a repeating code block.

We used a quote block to visually differentiate Terminal commands from code.

Learning Best Practices For Web Writing
In addition to user guides, developers also write documentation for their peers and company stakeholders. Most of this writing exists in a web format. As such, it is important to construct documents that maximize readability on the web.

Readability
People read technical writing to retrieve information and not for pleasure (typically). We streamlined our writing to be clear, concise, and complete to provide the necessary information as effectively as possible.

We ensured that every procedure page had an overview that would give the reader a preview of the topic before going through the detailed steps. At the end, we included a conclusion to summarize what the reader would have accomplished from following the guide.

Chunking
Due to the nature of our topic, we anticipated long informative pages. This can easily become difficult for a reader to follow. Knowing this, we focused on using sub-headings and figures to guide the reader.

We chose a navigation style (from MkDocs) that would show the subheadings for the current page as nested links. This allows our reader to gauge the relevancy of the material and jump to a specific section if they desired.

Tone
This documentation is intended for beginner to intermediate users who want to improve their Excel skills for personal or professional use. Thus, we kept the jargon to a minimum, as we did not want to confuse any beginner users. Any specialized terminology included a hyperlink to an external resource if the reader needed further explanation.

Conclusion
This documentation recorded our understanding of Microsoft Excel. The topic was familiar to us but helped brush up on our Excel knowledge.

Writing this documentation presented us the opportunity to practice writing clear instructions for our intended audience to read off the web.

It was a pleasure to work with my partner for this project, our solid communication skills aided us in smoothing our development process.

Thank you for your interest in our Excel User Documentation. We hope this documentation can be a good reference for our readers and for ourselves in future projects.
