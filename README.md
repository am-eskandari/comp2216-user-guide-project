# Excel User Guide Documentation

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains the user guide for Microsoft Excel, a powerful spreadsheet application used for organizing, analyzing, and storing data. Our guide focuses on essential Excel features, including creating tables, formatting formulas, and generating charts, to help users become proficient in using Excel.

## Our Collaboration Experience

- Our team had a smooth and enjoyable experience working together, thanks to our previous collaboration and adherence to our working agreement. We chose Excel as the subject of our user guide because it's a fundamental skill applicable to various fields.

- We used MkDocs and Visual Studio Code to create this user guide. Visual Studio Code is a versatile and user-friendly IDE, while MkDocs allows us to produce aesthetically pleasing and well-organized user guides.

## Overview of Excel User Guide

This user guide provides essential knowledge and hands-on experience to become proficient in using Microsoft Excel. The topics covered in this guide include:

## Our Collaboration Process

Our team collaborated effectively through online communication, primarily using Discord for instant messaging and Zoom for brainstorming sessions. We employed Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation, creating separate branches for each new page before merging the changes to the main branch.

## Creating the User Guide with MkDocs

We chose MkDocs as our static site generator for its visually appealing Material theme and built-in components. The additional plugins available to our team allowed us to customize the appearance of our documentation even further.

## Writing in Markdown and Using VS Code

The majority of our team members were new to writing extensively in Markdown. We learned how to style text using Markdown and improved our skills throughout the development of this user guide. We wrote our Markdown files in Visual Studio Code and used its built-in preview feature to check our work.

## Following a Style Guide

To maintain uniformity in our writing, we adhered to a specific style guide inspired by IEEE. We formatted code using code blocks and leveraged MkDocs features such as annotations and code highlighting to enhance the visual flow of our guide.

## Focusing on Web Writing Best Practices

We ensured that our user guide was easy to read and understand by incorporating best practices for web writing, including:

- Streamlining our writing to be clear, concise, and complete.
- Providing an overview and conclusion for each topic.
- Using subheadings and figures to guide the reader.
- Writing in a casual tone with minimal jargon.

## Conclusion
